# Spotify-Statistics

A Website that shows the logged in user, their Top Artists and Tracks, using data from their Spotify usage. I decided to build this project, as I didn't want to wait till the end of the year for Spotify to release Spotify Wrapped.The required data is retrieved from the Spotify API. I have not deployed this app live on the web yet, as I would have to submit an application to Spotify, to request the addition of additional users(The default limit is 25). I plan to do this, but only after I have added some additional features.

### Current features:

Finding out who your favourite artists are and what your favourite songs are.

Viewing interesting stats about your Favourite Artists and Favourite Songs.

Playing a 30- second preview of your favourite song.

Track how many followers you have, in real time.


### Tech Stack:

Frontend: React(with help from MaterialUI :) )

Backend:  Express, with Node as a runtime enviroment

Packages: Listed in the package.json file.
